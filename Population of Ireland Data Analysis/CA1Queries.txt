Question 1 Queries
1.B SELECT COUNT(`County`) FROM `population`
1.C DESCRIBE `population`
1.D SELECT `County`, max(`Pop`), min(`Pop`), AVG(`Pop`) FROM `population` GROUP BY `County`
1.E SELECT `Year`,sum(`Pop`) FROM `population` GROUP BY `Year`
1.F Completed in excel - see excel for answer
1.G SELECT `Year`, `County`, `Pop` from population WHERE County ='Dublin' and year >=1961 (get dublin part) - rest done in excel
1.H SELECT `Year`, `County`, `Pop` from population WHERE County ='Dublin'
1.I SELECT `County`, `Year`, MAX(`Pop`) FROM `population` GROUP BY `Year`, `County` ORDER BY population.County, population.Year (Getting each year of each county with 
max pop going from highest to lowest)
Year 2016 max pop - (SELECT `Year`, MAX(`Pop`) FROM `population` WHERE `Year` = 2016)
